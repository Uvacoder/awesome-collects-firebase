## Adding an new Item

- Add a new item to the bottom of the list in a section.

- Check your spelling & grammar.

### Valid Sources

Roughly speaking, a source is considered valid if - it could be used by a development team or beginner today on a new Firebase project and not lead them astray.

An item is NOT valid if:

- it is an archived GitHub (or other) repository
- it is an outed project that is no longer actively maintained AND it's the type of project that requires maintenance. Eg: [minimist](https://github.com/substack/minimist) is an unmaintained project but it would still qualify as it doesn't particularly require maintenance.

An item can still be VALID if:

- it is a heavily used project/article (npm downloads being one metric)
- it is a heavily referenced project/article

## Languages

We should aim to support all languages that the Firebase docs support. At the time of writing this is:

- KO: í•œêµ­ì–´
- ZH-CN: ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡
- JA: æ—¥æœ¬èªž
- PT-BR: PortuguÃªs Brasileiro
- ES-419: EspaÃ±ol (AmÃ©rica Latina)
- EN: English
- ID: Bahasa Indonesia

If you wish to see this list in another language, please create a PR with translations for items where you can. There is already some boilerplate for the aforementioned languages in the README lines 12-20.

For languages not in the above list.

- Create a README suffixed with your [language code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp). Eg: `README_KO.md` for Korean.
- Add your [language code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) to the list at the top of the root english (README.md lines 12-20).

### Adding a non-English item to the English README

If you are adding an item that is not english, please translate the item name and description to english, but include the [language code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) between the emoji and item name so readers know the language of the resource before heading there.

```markdown
- ðŸ”Œ ko [item name](https link) - Description beginning with capital, ending in period.
- ðŸ”Œ ja [item name](https link) - Description beginning with capital, ending in period.
```
